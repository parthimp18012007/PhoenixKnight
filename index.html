        <h2>Powers of Phoenix</h2>
        <p>Due to Phoenix Knight's biology it is impossible to say if his body is fused to his armor or if he has a body at all under it. With the possibility of being nothing more then a sentient energy trapped inside of it. He does not need to eat or sleep as well. He is much faster and stronger then most other species as he was designed to be. But due to living for tens of thousands of years his power that sustains him has become weaker over time.</p>
        <h2 id="section-phoenix">Role in history</h2>
        <p>No matter what age you look at, you will find the mention Phoenix Knight in there somewhere along the way. Making hard to deny his existence to even the most skeptical. He has always been an influence to those around him and has changed the some parts of the world either politically or through the many conflicts that he has been apart of. Due his long life span it is difficult to make out ever deed he has ever done both large and small. But his role in the world has been instrumental in help avoid to total destruction of civilization and stopping threats that would plunge the world into chaos and tyranny. Along with several occasions halting the Scion and his dark forces from a world controlled by darkness. Making him one of the most influential beings in the world that is still living at the moment. But it has caused many to fear him as he has the power to tear apart the world if he wanted to. Though most people respect him more for maintain his duty for so long even through most would have already been broke by such a task such as his. But here he remains to this day refusing to fade into darkness as the world tears itself apart like it usually does.</p>
